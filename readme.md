# TypeScript

Following along the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) course about TypeScript.

From Chapter 4 onward, you need to pay for the membership or test locally, they give you the **main_test** and a basic (uncompleted) **utils** file. I recreated the **unit_test** file by myself in order to match their test cases.

Once I complete the utils file of each section, I run the corresponding **main_test** file, with the command:

```
npx ts-node main_test.ts
```
