/* Type Parameters for Types
 *
 * Type parameters aren't just limited to functions and methods.
 * You can use type parameters to create generic types as well.
 *
 * Assignment
 * The infra team at Support.ai is building
 * a shared job queue for internal systemsâ€”model retraining,
 * cache invalidation, moderation sync, and more.
 *
 * Take a look at the createQueue function
 * that's been created for you.
 * It creates a new generic JobQueue data structure.
 *
 * Define a new JobQueue<T> type with:
 *   * A push method that matches the implementation in createQueue
 *   * A next method that matches the implementation in createQueue
 *
 * Write and export a new generic runNext function.
 * It simply accepts a JobQueue, calls its next method
 * and returns the result.
