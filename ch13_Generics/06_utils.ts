 * Assignment
 * Support.ai is launching experiments again.
 * Youâ€™ve been asked to implement a class
 * that manages feature flags by name.
 * At Support.ai we commit to features.
 * Once a flag is enabled, there's no going back.
 *
 * Complete the FeatureFlag class.
 * It should keep track of all the enabled flags,
 * and allow users of the class to enable
 * new flags and check if a flag is enabled.
