/* Intersecting Incompatible Types
 * When combining explicit types with one o more properties
 * with the same name and type, the resulting type is a merge
 * of those properties, there are no problems.
 *
 * When the types have properties with the same name but the
 * diffrent types, the combination results in type never.
 * The solution is to redesign the types to avoid incompatible
 * intersections.
 *
 * Assignment
 * Support.ai enriches customer tickets with two types of metadata:
 *
 *   Sentiment tags, which describe the emotional tone of the message.
 *   Channel tags, which describe how the message was received.
 *
 * These two types were combined using an intersection
 * to create the TicketMetadata type â€” but there's a bug!
 * Hover over TicketMetadata and notice that it's "never"
 * due to an incompatible intersection.
 *
 * Update the TicketMetadata to hold both the SentimentTag
 * and ChannelTag types inside it as properties.
 * Call them sentiment and channel respectively.
 *
 * Update the getReviewMethod function to work
 * with your new nested structure.
 * It should have the same logic as before:
 *
 * getReviewMethod should return "manual_review" if any of the following are true:
 *
 *   The sentiment is flagged
 *   The channel is not verified
 *   The channel type is "phone"
 *
 * Otherwise, it should return "auto_process".
