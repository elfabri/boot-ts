/* The Never Type
 * Represents values that can't occur.
 *
 * Assignment
 * Support.ai's chatbot supports slash commands.
 * When a developer adds a new slash command
 * (the slashCommands union), we want TypeScript
 * to ensure that the handleSlashCommand accounts for it.
 *
 * Run the code as-is, and notice the compile-time errors.
 *
 * Fix the error by ensuring the handleSlashCommand
 * handles all types of slash commands.
